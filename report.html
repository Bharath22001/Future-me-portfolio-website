<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The site depicts a version of myself 10 years in the future showcasing the journey I have taken over the years. It is a version of myself that has successfully honed my craft as a computer science major by pursuing further studies and eventually achieving my goal of being a Quantum Engineer at IBM. The site not only attempts to convey my story to potential employers, but to my present self as well. Therefore, this site not only acts as a self introduction to potential employers but also acts as a sneak peak for me to peer into the future.  </p>
<p>Taking this vision into account, I have decided to curate a storytelling experience that mimics the idea of my future-self sending me text messages, pictures and videos of my achievements. This can be seen in the ‘About Me’ page where as the user scrolls through the messages on the smartphone, new messages will appear from my future-self about my career highlights throughout the years. Additionally, ‘Projects’ page will have smartphones playing media of the projects I have developed and ‘Contact Me’ page will have text bubbles floating around containing excerpts from reviews of me sent by colleagues over the years.</p>
<p>The structure of my website consists of 5 pages, following the  flat structure appraoch where in my case all pages are directly accessible from the home page. The first page is the “Home” page which is responsible for capturing the visitor’s attention and giving a short summary of myself. The second page is the “About Me” page which contains a timeline with information of my journey over the next 10 years. The third page is the “Experience” page that showcases the proficiency percentages of the various programming languages that I am experienced with. Additionally, it also contains a section that lists the frameworks at my disposal with each framework tied to a popup that details what the framework is used for and my proficiency with it. The fourth page is the “Projects” page which showcases the various projects that I have done. The last page is the “Contact Me” page with the top half showing the various reviews left by others about me while also allowing visitors to upload their own reviews of me. The bottom half allows the users to contact me through either inputting their own email and details into the input box or through my social media.</p>

<h2>Inspiration</h2>
<p>The first professional portfolio website that inspired ideas for my website is <a href="https://www.arlenmccluskey.com/">“https://www.arlenmccluskey.com/”</a>. The developer behind that website used an interesting approach towards showcasing media by playing them through a container made to resemble a smartphone while having the media play in loop. This idea enticed me as its addition would be perfect for my website since my story is being told through smartphones. Similar to the reference website, I also had videos playing in a loop by converting them into a Graphics Interchange Format (GIF) format. Thus, giving life to the webpage by not making it seem static. </p>
<p>The second portfolio website that inspired me was <a href="http://findmatthew.com/"> “http://findmatthew.com/”</a>. The developer behind this website made use of scroll-based animations which I was impressed with as it was simple yet effective in drawing my attention to certain sections of the webpage. I had deemed this to be incredibly important for a portfolio website as the goal is to effectively highlight key areas such as the skills and tools that I have at my disposal. Thus, I added simple animations to the “Experience” page’s language proficiency bar chart where each language’s respective bar grows in size to eventually reveal my proficiency rating. I felt that this animation, though simple, helped to emphasize my mastery of languages with higher proficiency ratings as it would invoke the thought in the user's mind saying “How much more will this bar chart grow?”. </p>
<p>The third portfolio website that I was inspired by was <a href="https://gardenestudio.com.br/">“https://gardenestudio.com.br/”</a>. This website showcased the artistic touch that parallax scrolling effect is capable of instilling into a website. The scrolling effect helps to add depth to a website while also sometimes aiding in the story telling aspect of a portfolio website. I deemed that it would be a great addition to my website’s “Home” page as this website I have created is the first medium of communication I would have with potential employers. Therefore, I needed to give my website the ability to capture the visitor’s attention and inspire curiosity in them before my story is shared with them.</p>
<br>
<h2>Accessibility</h2>
<p>The first way I have made my website accessible is through a clear and consistent navigation system. All of my website pages have the exact same navigation menu with clearly separated links to the various pages. Additionally, the navigation menu intelligently removes webpage links based on the page the viewer is currently on. This helps to reduce clutter in the navigation menu. Having a consistent and clear navigation menu will be incredibly useful for users with cognitive or learning disabilities by making it easier for them to find and access the content they need.</p>
<p>The second accessibility feature I have implemented is the usage of high contrast colours across all web pages which uses colours that have a sufficient difference in brightness and saturation between the background and foreground elements, such as text and images. This is helpful to those with visual impairments such as colour blindness, low vision and vision sensitivity by reducing discomfort and strain trying to differentiate elements. An example of this implementation can be found in the “Home” page where the overlay text that transitions from “Hello,” to “I’m Bharath” changes text colour from white to black in accordance to the changing background colour while scrolling.</p>
<p>The third accessibility feature is viewport size responsiveness. I have provided my website with the ability to restructure its size and element positionings automatically such that it can be viewed through any device regardless of size. This will be helpful to those with disabilities as it allows them to comfortably visit my webpage through their preferred device while still getting the full experience. </p>
<br>
<h2>Usability</h2>
<P>The first way that site usability was taken into account was through mobile responsiveness. As aforementioned, I have designed my navigation menu such that it is clutter-free with clearly separated links. Moreover, links are also hidden from the navigation menu based on the page the visitor is currently on. Usability was also taken into account by allowing the navigation menu to restructure into a hamburger navigation menu when it is detected that the visitor is viewing the page from small display sizes. This makes it such that on mobile devices, the navigation menu is hidden behind a hamburger button. This ensures that the navigation menu is unobstructive and consumes little real estate on the already small mobile viewport sizes.</P>
<p>The second usability feature is the use of prominent Calls-to-Action (CTAs) which directs users to take certain necessary steps. The CTAs found throughout my web pages are positioned clearly with the use of eye-catching colours or notifications. An instance of this can be seen in the “Contact Me” page where if the user fails to correctly fill any of the input boxes within the contact me section, there will be a notification prompting the user of their error.</p>
<p>The third usability is mobile friendliness and responsiveness. My website has the ability to automatically adapt itself to varying viewport sizes. Depending on the size, my website will also restructure certain elements to provide a pleasant viewing experience to the user by eliminating improper positioning of any elements that extend past the viewport bounds. An instance of this would be in my “Experience” page where the framework icons will normally be positioned in a single row on desktop viewport sizes. However on mobile devices, the framework icons will restructure into a 2 by 2 grid to ensure that all elements are appropriately positioned on the screen.</p>
<br>
<h2>Learning</h2>
<p>Prior to starting this project, my understanding and proficiency of javascript was subpar but I was still determined to incorporate advanced javascript code into my website in order to include exciting animations and interactiveness. To achieve this, I took a deep dive into concepts such as event handling and DOM manipulation through the help of online sources as well as consultation with my professor. I had tried and failed many times before eventually succeeding in incorporating animations such as the floating review bubble in the “Contact Me” page that reacts to the cursor by putting all of my learnings together and consistently learning from my errors.</p>
<p>The second thing that I had to learn was how to correctly and efficiently incorporate responsiveness into my website. At the beginning, I produced inefficient and poor quality code by using ‘vw’ and ‘clamp’ for tasks that had better methods to produce responsiveness. I eventually learned about how I could make use of media queries, CSS grid and flexbox. I then studied how to efficiently and tastefully utilise them to achieve responsiveness for my pages. An instance of me using CSS grid can be seen in the “Experience” page where the framework icons are created using the grid system.</p>
<p>The third thing I learnt was how to create templates using Handlebars.js. Firstly I had to learn about both Mustache and Handlebars.js to determine which is better suited for my needs. After deciding on Handlebars.js, I had to thoroughly study what it is and how I can bring out its full functionality. This can be seen from the “Projects” page where the mobile phones showing the videos of my projects are fully made with a template that I had developed by myself using Handlebars.js.</p>
<br>
<h2>Evaluation I</h2>
<p>I believe that my website was successful in creating an interactive story for its viewers. Throughout my web pages, there are many avenues for the visitors to click and interact with the story being told. This can be seen from the “About Me” page where my timeline was not merely just presented fully at once, instead the visitor has to scroll to reveal more. The “Contact Me” page is also another example of this as it imbues a personal element into the website by allowing the visitor to craft their own review of me and once sent, they can see it float around alongside the other reviews while also interacting with it using their cursor.</p>
<p>Additionally, interactive elements were also used as means of reducing clutter on my web pages which I believe to be a successful implementation of design elements that offers functionality and meaning beyond aesthetics. This can be seen in the “Experience” page where further information regarding frameworks can be found in the clickable popup. It is unrealistic to expect all visitors to be well-versed in all available frameworks and their uses, therefore users are capable of finding the explanation they need to the relevant frameworks in my page without additional browsing, thus creating a user-centric design. This also helps to reduce clutter in my page which in return reduces strain and provides the user with a more pleasant browsing experience.</p>
<p>I am also proud of the fact that I was able to create the aforementioned animations and effects as well as the “Home”  page’s parallax scrolling effect without the use of any external libraries. Instead, I have crafted the code for all of them using vanilla Javascript alone, meaning that I have been able to achieve all the intended design and functionality elements without the use of my external libraries as shortcuts.</p>
<br>
<h2>Evaluation II</h2>
<p>I believe that my site could benefit from incorporating animation javascript libraries such as "GSAP". The home page’s parallax scrolling is an example of this as, even though my current parallax scrolling effect is present and functions as envisioned, I believe that I could utilise animation libraries to instil additional interactivity and seamlessness. Animation libraries would also be greatly helpful in providing animation effects to other texts and images present in my website. Thus, greatly improving the story telling aspect of my website by bringing focus to the aspects of the webpage that needs attention when needed, improving the flow to the story being told. </p>
<p>I also believe that my website would stand to benefit from additional accessibility and usability features. My current website offers great assistance to those with visual impairments by intentionally using high contrast colours, legible typography, etc. This aspect of my work could be further improved by incorporating a text-to-speech reader as my website lacks this feature that is essential to certain individuals. Hence, next time, I would be more intentional with which aspects of the website that I place my focus on as I had spent too much time improving the animation and aesthetics of my webpage instead of catering key accessibility features to those in need of them. Usability could also be improved by offering dark mode support to users viewing my webpage from dim-lit rooms as this would curate a more pleasant browsing experience by eliminating eye strain.</p>
